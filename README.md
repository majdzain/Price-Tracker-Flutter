- Your json data about **Active Symbols**(Used to retrieve the current symbols) that retrieved from the API the single object should contains:
```
{
  "active_symbols": [
    {

      "display_order": 23,
      "market": "synthetic_index",
      "market_display_name": "Derived",

      "symbol": "WLDAUD",
      "symbol_type": "forex_basket"
    }
  ]
}
```

    "quote": 215.4303,
    "symbol": "R_50"
  }
}
```
